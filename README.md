# Welcome to the Survey Clustering Analysis project

As government contractors, the United States Air Force (USAF) provided our team with survey data in order to to identify overall trends in organizational climate. 
Survey questions were asked on a variety of topics including: training, resources, morale, and leadership. The USAF leadership wanted to see if we could pair the survey
responses with group morale data in order to identify trends in why some units had moderate to positive group morale and others had plummetting morale scores. 

Understandably the data and presentation results needed to be sanitized before I could post the project on GitHub. 
The names of USAF units, service member unit identification, and descriptions of source data were changed or removed to preserve privacy.
But the tools and methods as well as some of the sanitized results are still available for display. 

* Input/survey_data_processed_scrambled.csv: The processed source of data for the survey analysis. Contains the individual service member responses to survey questions along with proxies for their associated Wings and Locations (all sanitized to preserve privacy)
* Simplified_Clustering_scrambled.ipynb: The jupyter notebook which loaded the data, conducted the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and produced the results of the Gaussian Mixture cluster model.
* Sanitized Cluster Analysis Presentation.pptx: A sanitized subset recreation of the PowerPoint results I presented to USAF leadership in 2022.
