       "      I have enough time to accomplish my daily workload during my normal duty hours  I have the equipment (tools, spare parts, information technology, safety gear, etc.) I need to do my job the right way  I have the opportunity to develop other professional skills  I have the opportunity to develop/improve my AFSC/Special Duty Identifier-related skills  I trust my leadership chain, from my supervisor to my Wing Commander (or FOA/DRU Commander)  I would be able to complete my assigned tasks if my work center lost communications capability  Individuals in my unit are comfortable approaching supervisors about personal problems  Members of my unit take good care of the equipment they use  My commander is concerned about my personal welfare  My deployment schedule is predictable enough for me to plan and participate in off-duty activities  My duty schedule is predictable enough for me to plan and participate in off-duty activities  My job is designed so I know when I have performed well  \\\n",
